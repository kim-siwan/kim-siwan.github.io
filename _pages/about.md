👉 I'm starting my PhD in Data Science at the University of Virginia.

Over the years, I have shaped human-centered design perspective and problem solving skills both from industry and academia. 

With 3+ years of UX design practice,
I realized that what excites me most is the potential of emerging technology to enhance human capabilities, and now, I’m deeply passionate about exploring how AI can empower human creativity and productivity rather than replace them. 

Now, I'm looking to transition from a designer to a researcher in my PhD journey, focusing on human-centered AI with data-driven approach.
